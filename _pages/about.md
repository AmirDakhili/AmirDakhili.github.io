Hi! I’m Amir Hossein Dakhili, a PhD candidate in the Neuroscience of Addiction and Mental Health Program at the Healthy Brain and Mind Research Centre, Australian Catholic University (ACU). My research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying addiction, with particular interests in cannabis use disorder, methamphetamine use, and behavioral addictions such as gambling.

My work combines ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI, real-time neuroimaging, and off-line analysis pipelines to investigate how brain networks support craving, cognitive control and decision making. A central focus of my current research is ROI-based real-time fMRI neurofeedback, where I examine whether individuals with cannabis use disorder can volitionally modulate brain activity and how these neural changes relate to subjective craving and learning across sessions.
